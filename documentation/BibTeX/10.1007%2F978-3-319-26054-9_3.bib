abstract="We begin this tutorial by discussing the features of the Catkin build system. We then proceed by giving a thorough explanation of ROS callback functions in terms of sensor data. We utilize the Qt5 libraries to make a very simple Graphical User Interface to control the robot with on screen buttons, as well as view position information in                                                                           {\$}{\$}(x, y, {\backslash}theta ){\$}{\$}                                                                                    (                        x                        ,                        y                        ,                        $\theta$                        )                                                                             coordinates. This GUI will use the Qt thread library as well as ROS messages to control and provide information about the state of the robot.",
