  abstract      = {MoveIt! is state of the art software for mobile manipulation, incorporating the latest advances in motion planning, manipulation, 3D perception, kinematics, control and navigation. It provides an easy-to-use platform for developing advanced robotics applications, evaluating new robot designs and building integrated robotics products for industrial, commercial, R{\&}D and other domains. MoveIt! is the most widely used open-source software for manipulation and has been used on over 65 different robots. This tutorial is intended for both new and advanced users: it will teach new users how to integrate MoveIt! with their robots while advanced users will also be able to get information on features that they may not be familiar with.},
